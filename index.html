        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p class="underheadinfo">My name is Garrett Allred, I am currently a student at Lone Star college attempting to get my <strong>AAS</strong><em>(Associate Of Science)</em> in mobile/web development.
          I am trying to learn faster than my school is teaching me currently. I Am hoping that this course will teach me what I need to know a little faster and depending on how i feel in the next few months
          I may leave college temporaraly to attend a web development Bootcamp. Hopefully one day I can get a great job developing some of the worlds best websites either remotely or in a comfortable work space.</p>

          <p class="learner-text-description">I am able to take on a task I don't know much about and with some time and a few resources, I am able to complete the task. For example, when I use to build robots for fun, I started with
          nothing but a Raspberry PI and some components to add on to it. Using the Resources I had avliable (i.e Google, Youtube) I quickly learned within a few months how to make a remote control car
          that I was able to control with my laptop.</p>

          <p class="swim-text-description">When I was about 13 years old, my family moved to Houston, Texas. When we moved, our new house came with a swimming pool. I was so excited, and from
          day 1 I was hooked. I played in it day after day for fun. Just over 5 years later I have come to realize, I can hold my breath for longer than all of my friends. As well as swim faster
        than them.</p>
